# concurrency
my pathetic attempts at the university concurrency labworks

This repository contains the following labworks:
- Labwork 1: Dining Philosophers in C++.
- Labwork 2: Asynchronous Computations in Python.
- Labwork 3: Process Monitor in Python.
- Bonus Labwork 1: Dining Philosophers in Java.
- Bonus Labwork 3: Shared Memory Computations in Python.

Every labwork directory contains:
- a source code file (`.{cpp,py,java}`);
- sample output file (`.txt`).
